# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed
- `screenshot`/`tap`/`swipe` (Android): coordinates silently landed on the wrong element on high-density devices. Android returned the screenshot at full physical resolution (e.g. Pixel 9 Pro `1280×2856`) while tapping in that same pixel space — internally consistent, but the host downscales a wide image before the vision model sees it, so positions read off the smaller preview were passed straight to `tap` and landed off by the density factor (~1.43× on a 3× device). Android now mirrors the iOS points path: the screenshot is downscaled to density-independent pixels (dp, `density_dpi/160`, e.g. `~427×952`) and `tap`/`swipe` scale incoming dp coordinates back up to pixels by the same factor, so the image the model sees and the coordinate space it types in are the same. The `tap` focus-frame check now compares in pixel space (where `dumpsys window`'s frame lives). PNG downscaling is done in-process via a dependency-free `zlib`-based codec, so no native image dependency or external tool is required. iOS is unchanged.

### Fixed
- SQLite tools returned empty results (`{ rowCount: 0, rows: [] }`) for every query, and swallowed errors from guaranteed-invalid SQL. The Metro/fusebox CDP inspector does not honor `Runtime.evaluate`'s `awaitPromise`: a promise that settles on a later tick is serialized as an empty object and rejections are lost. Since SQLite access is genuinely async (native callbacks) — unlike the synchronous MMKV hook — awaiting inside the eval never worked. The tools now drive the hook with synchronous evals only: one eval starts the operation and stashes its outcome on a global slot, then the MCP polls that slot until it settles (with a timeout and cleanup). `Promise.resolve()` wrapping makes this transparent for both sync (`getAllSync`/`runSync`) and async (`getAllAsync`/`runAsync`) hooks.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- SQLite tools that talk to a dev-only app hook at `globalThis.__EXPO_METRO_MCP__.sqlite` (works with `expo-sqlite`, including under Drizzle/Kysely):
  - `sqlite_query` — read-only statements (`SELECT`/`WITH`/`PRAGMA`/`EXPLAIN`) with `?` bind params; returns `{ rowCount, rows }`
  - `sqlite_exec` — write statements (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/DDL); returns `{ changes, lastInsertRowId }`; disabled when `EXPO_METRO_MCP_READ_ONLY=1`
  - `sqlite_tables` — list user tables and views (internal `sqlite_*` tables excluded)
  - `sqlite_schema` — a table's `CREATE` SQL, columns, foreign keys, and indexes
- The read/write split is enforced at the tool boundary: `sqlite_query` rejects any non-read statement, so mutations must go through `sqlite_exec`.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- `screenshot` (iOS): the backing scale was guessed from pixel dimensions and picked 3× for the 2× iPad Pro 13" (its 2064px width is divisible by 3), so the returned image was 1.5× smaller than idb's point space and taps/swipes landed at ~2/3 of the intended position. The scale is now read authoritatively from `idb describe --json` (`density`), with the pixel heuristic kept only as a fallback.
- `swipe` (iOS): duration was passed as a positional argument, which `idb ui swipe` rejects with "unrecognized arguments"; it is now passed as `--duration`.
- CDP connection: the inspector WebSocket now sends an `Origin` header (required by RN 0.76+/fusebox `dev-middleware`, which otherwise returns HTTP 401) whose host matches Expo's `serverBaseUrl` (`127.0.0.1`). Expo's dev server terminates the debugger socket immediately (abnormal 1006) when the Origin host is `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`; the client now tries `127.0.0.1` first and falls back to `localhost`, adapting on an abnormal early close.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- Android `tap` now runs a pre-flight focus check via `dumpsys window`:
  - Blocks the tap with an explicit error and recovery commands when a system ANR ("Application Not Responding") dialog has focus — `adb shell input tap` would otherwise silently route the event to the dialog
  - New optional `expected_package` parameter; emits a warning when the focused window belongs to a different package (e.g. stale Activity instance, OS prompt, or another app on top)
  - Warns when tap coordinates fall outside the focused window's frame (skipping degenerate `0×0` overlay frames to avoid false positives)

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `EXPO_METRO_MCP_READ_ONLY=1` to disable MMKV/Zustand write helpers at the server layer
- `EXPO_METRO_MCP_MMKV_PREFIX_ALLOWLIST` to constrain MMKV/Zustand access to explicit key prefixes

### Changed
- `evaluate` is now registered only when `EXPO_METRO_MCP_ENABLE_EVAL=1` is set
- `mmkv_keys` now filters results through the MMKV prefix allowlist when configured

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `mmkv_get_json`, `mmkv_set_json`, and `mmkv_merge_json` helpers for JSON-valued MMKV entries
- `zustand_persist_get`, `zustand_persist_set`, and `zustand_persist_merge` helpers for seeding and patching persisted Zustand state in the usual `{ state, version? }` shape

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `mmkv_get`, `mmkv_set`, `mmkv_remove`, and `mmkv_keys` tools for apps that expose a dev-only MMKV debug hook at `globalThis.__EXPO_METRO_MCP__.mmkv`

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `evaluate` — run JavaScript directly inside the connected React Native runtime via Metro CDP `Runtime.evaluate`, with async support and formatted return values/errors

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `input_text` — type text into the focused input field without requiring the on-screen keyboard (Android: `adb shell input text`, iOS: `idb ui text`)
- `input_key` — send special key presses: enter, backspace, delete, tab, escape, home, end, back, space, arrow keys (Android: `adb shell input keyevent`, iOS: `idb ui key` with HID codes)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `screenshot` now returns image dimensions (`width x height` in px) alongside the image. The MCP includes a text note with the exact pixel size so callers never need to guess or manually calculate a scale factor for `tap`/`swipe` coordinates

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Minify dist output (32KB → 19KB)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `get_logs` — fetch recent logs from the Metro buffer with optional level and time filters
- `get_errors` — fetch recent errors with stack traces
- `get_status` — connection status, device name, and buffer statistics
- `connect` — grab the CDP connection from Metro
- `disconnect` — release the CDP connection so React Native DevTools can connect freely
- `clear_logs` — clear the log buffer
- `watch_logs` — poll for incoming logs for a time window
- `reload` — reload the React Native app via Metro
- `resolve_stack` — resolve stack traces against the Metro source map, showing original file/line instead of bundle offsets
- `list_devices` — list active iOS simulators and Android emulators
- `screenshot` — capture a screenshot from the active simulator/emulator. iOS screenshots are automatically downscaled to logical point resolution to match tap coordinates
- `tap` — tap at x,y coordinates on iOS simulator (via idb) or Android emulator (via adb)
- `swipe` — swipe gesture on iOS simulator (via idb) or Android emulator (via adb)

### Notes
- iOS tap/swipe requires `idb`: `brew tap facebook/fb && brew install idb-companion && pip3 install fb-idb`
- `idb_companion` is spawned automatically on first tap/swipe
- Android automation works out of the box via `adb`
